## ⚡ DragonBurn (but safer)

This is a **fork** of [ByteCorum/DragonBurn](https://github.com/ByteCorum/DragonBurn), just… UserMode.  

*
*
*
***
since the original project is not really public cause you have to use a private driver and it makes you install it in any way you open up the program i have decided it was enough and made DragonBurn USERMODE and actually PUBLIC, i can assure you that you have the same chance of being cought by vac with this method but ITS YOUR OWN RISK AS ALLWAYS

Everything here was generated, tweaked, or outright ruined by an AI. I reserve the right to update or break whatever I feel like, whenever I feel like. No deadlines. No apologies.

If you spot bugs or have ideas for improvements—great, open an issue. I might care. I might forget. Such is life.

### 🔧 What's actually different (and why you'll care)

- **No kernel driver dependency**  
  - **Old way**: Requires sussy kernel mode driver + mapper setup  
  - **New way**: Pure user-mode with handle hijacking  
  No more dealing with `unknown drivers` or kernel mappers. Less setup, less hassle.

- **Handle hijacking memory access**  
  - **Old way**: DeviceIoControl calls through a sussy kernel driver  
  - **New way**: NT API handle hijacking techniques, 
   Different approach, same results.
      - **that method worked on a "esp cheat" for a couple of years with 0 ban reports** 
   

- **All the same features**  
  - ✨ **Aimbot**: Still works if you want it to  
  - 🎯 **ESP**: Still shows enemies through walls  
  - 📊 **Radar**: Still trash  
  - 🔫 **RCS**: Still trash  
  - ⚡ **TriggerBot**: Still shoots for your dead brain

- **Safer startup**  
  No more "Looking for PRIVATE kernel Drivers" Safer for your pc and works with not hassle.

### 🚀 How to not mess this up

1. **Requirements**  
   - Visual Studio (the real one, not Code)  
   - Windows (obviously)  
   - A functioning brain (optional but recommended)

2. **Building**  
   - Open `DragonBurn.sln`  
   - Hit F5 or whatever  
   - Run as Admin because Windows is paranoid

3. **Usage**  
   - Start CS2  
   - Run this thing  
   - Don't be obvious about it

### 📌 Disclaimer

If you need a step-by-step guide for "Hello World," this isn't the place. Proceed only if you enjoy a little DIY mayhem and understand that cheating might get you banned.
