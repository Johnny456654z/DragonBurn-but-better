## ⚡ DragonBurn (but better)

This is a **fork** of [ByteCorum/DragonBurn](https://github.com/ByteCorum/DragonBurn), just… twisted.  
Everything here was generated, tweaked, or outright ruined by an AI. I reserve the right to update or break whatever I feel like, whenever I feel like. No deadlines. No apologies.

If you spot bugs or have ideas for improvements—great, open an issue. I might care. I might forget. Such is life.

### 🔧 What’s actually different (and why you’ll care)

- **Aimbot toggle + PrecisionMode**  
  - **Original behavior** (PrecisionMode **OFF**): exactly the same aimbot you knew before—nothing changes.  
  - **Enhanced behavior** (PrecisionMode **ON**): snappier target tracking, smoother aim adjustments, and about **100×** more satisfying headshot potential.  
  Flip the switch to upgrade; leave it off to stay classic.

- **Spec list overhaul**  
  Actually works now:  
  - 🔴 You’re spectating them.  
  - 🔵 Somebody else is spectating them.  
  - 🟢 Somebody’s creepily spectating **you**.  
  Now you see who sees you. Spooky.

- **Config section cleaned up**  
  - ✨ **UI glow‑up**: sleek menus and clearer labels  
  - 🔍 **Active preview**: know which config is currently selected  
  - 📂 **Quick‑open**: one‑click access to your config folder  
  - 🔀 **Custom paths**: store configs wherever you damn well please

- **Lightweight performance tweaks**  
  Under-the-hood magic so your FPS stops crying. Legit, just try it; you’ll see.

- **VAC‑aware**  
  We’re not trying to get you banned, okay? Changes made with a tiny bit of anti-cheat caution. No guarantees, but at least we thought about it.
